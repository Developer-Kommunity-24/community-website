## 🌟 About DK24

DK24 is a revolutionary community initiative that bridges the gap between college tech communities across Mangalore, Karnataka. We're not here to replace existing college communities – we're the **bridge** that connects them all.

### 🎯 Our Mission
> *"The core and ultimate purpose of DK24 is to foster the learning and building environment among our peers and juniors, where we aim toward project-based learning, which will give rise to the next generation of engineers and tech entrepreneurs."*

### 🔮 Our Vision
> *"Our goal is to have a tech ecosystem in Mangalore in the next 10 years, where we will be having a diverse network, that any student who has an idea or the spark to do something, will have the best resource he/she can access in the city."*

### 🤔 Why DK24?
As independent college communities, we are just small pockets of resources spread over various places. We can utilize maximum power when there is sharing of resources and knowledge between these pockets, and **DK24 is the bridge connecting all of them together**.
